# Eclipse Browser
A modern, lightweight web browser without all of the heavy stuff other browsers come with.

# Download
You can download the latest build of Eclipse at https://github.com/EclipseUK/Browser/wiki/Downloads

# How to commit
This software is made in Visual Basic 2010, please don't use any other version of Visual Basic as it will break the file.
If your adding in a new feature, make it fit in with the rest of the gui (otherwise it will look a mess).

# Notice
This software is open source, mainly so community can patch bugs and add new feature. Please do not copy our code and rebrand it.

# Thank you
Thank you for reading this small document, give a main download link to the application when a version is ready to be distributed.
